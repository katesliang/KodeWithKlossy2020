# Kode With Klossy 2020
This repository highlights some of the work I made as a Web Development Scholar during Kode with Klossy 2020 (June 17-28). During camp, I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the jQuery library using [Glitch](https://www.glitch.com) and [repl.it](https://www.repl.it). Each branch is a different project! Enjoy :) 

## Projects 
1) **Travel Photo Gallery** - HTML, CSS
2) **Alt Tiktok Quiz (Mini Project 3)** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery)
3) **Diversity University (Final Project)** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery): An online platform that provides historically under-represented groups a safe place to leave an honest review about their university experience.
