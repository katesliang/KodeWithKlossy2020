Diversity University
=================

## The Problem 
Institutions often pride themselves on their student body's diversity. However, many minority students feel isolated and unsafe on campus. Nearly 40% of Native American college students felt like did they not belong on campus. Black students are twice more likely to report feeling physically unsafe than their white counterparts, and "first-generation, African-American, and Hispanic or Latino students were more likely to have difficulty getting help with their course work than their peers." 

## About Us
Diversity University aims to share true experiences of what's it like studying at a PWI (predominately white institution) with prospective students. As current minority students have a safe space to anonymously share their stories, they may also leave any resources for others like them, suggest improvements, and discover similar narratives. **We are a unique online platform that provides historically under-represented groups a safe place to leave an honest review about their university experience.** Currently, we have a page for universities in the Dallas Fort-Worth area. 

## Additional Info
App was built with HTML, CSS, JS in a team of 3. In the future, we hope to improve the design of the site, expand beyond the North Texas area, and incorporate a backend and use Google Maps API.
