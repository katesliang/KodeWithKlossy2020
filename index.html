        About
      </h3>
      <p>
        Diversity University (DU) is an unique online platform that provides
        historically under-represented groups a safe place to leave an honest
        review about their university experience. While institutions often pride
        themselves on their student body's diversity, many minority students
        feel isolated and unsafe on campus. In fact, according to
        <a class = "student-engagement"
          href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/17/nsse-survey-finds-lack-support-unsafe-feelings-among-minority-students"
        >
          the National Survey of Student Engagement</a
        >, nearly 40% of Native American college students felt like did they not
        belong on campus. Black students are twice more likely to report feeling
        physically unsafe than their white counterparts, and "first-generation,
        African-American, and Hispanic or Latino students were more likely to
        have difficulty getting help with their course work than their peers."
        We cannot overlook these concerning numbers, and it's time that higher
        education officials do more than utilize minority students as "tokens of
        diversity" and commit more into building a community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here at DU, we aim to share true experiences of what's it like studying
        at a PWI (predominately white institution) with prospective students. As
        current minority students have a safe space to anonymously share their
        stories, they may also leave any resources for others like them, suggest
        improvements, and discover similar narratives. It's important to note
        that our website does not only serve racial minorities, but also female,
        LGBTQ+, and non-Christian students. Our goal is to simply help current
        and future minority students find a welcoming atmosphere on campus while
        pressuring officials to do a better job. After all, post-secondary
        education is a crucial stepping stone for many students, and everyone
        should feel safe and included there.
